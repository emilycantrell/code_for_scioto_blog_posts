#### QUALITY ASSURANCE CHECKS ####

# Check that the enrollment numbers add up correctly 
sum(meal_data$Enrollment) == rowSums(program_enrollment)

# If the school lunch data is close to a complete accounting of schools in the state, the
# total count of children should be somewhere between 1.68 million (Ohio public school enrollment) 
# and 1.9 million (total Ohio school age population), to align with statistics from 
# https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest-dashboard/state/ohio
total_enrollment <- meal_data %>%
  summarise(total_enrollment = sum(Enrollment, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  pull(total_enrollment)
total_enrollment > 1680000 & total_enrollment < 1900000

# Note: The row Della School of Coding and Design says the proportion of students who receive
# reduced price lunch is 0.001779, which does not make sense for 60 students as it corresponds
# to 0.1 students. The row lists "Reduced Price Lunch Applications" as 0, so I assume 0 reduced
# price lunches for the school.
